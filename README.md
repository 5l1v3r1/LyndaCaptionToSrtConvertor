# LyndaCaptionToSrtConvertor
Convert .caption files from Lynda offline courses to srt subtitle files.

Lynda offline courses downloaded through the Lynda Desktop app store the videos as encrypted .lynda files 
and the captions as proprietary format .caption files. +

This app extracts the text and timestamps from the .caption files and turns the captions in popular .srt format subtitles.

Use: LyndaCaptionToSrtConvertor.exe /D directory_with_caption_files
